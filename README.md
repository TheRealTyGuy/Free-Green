# Free-Green

I am a person who likes the little green squares on my github profile. I like to think there are others who like them too. 

This project is for those who like those green squares, but don't want to work. Every day free green (assuming your computer is on) should commit fake work to Github for you.



**** Note!!!! I do not actually fake my work on github.
